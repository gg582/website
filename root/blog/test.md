As AI continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly important to have a programming language that can handle the demands of these applications.  Go could be the perfect choice for AI applications.

## Why Go is a great choice for AI applications

In short, AI applications are not a specialized field. As abstraction levels of AI applications increase, they are becoming more like general services geared towards integration. Go has a proven track record as an excellent choice for complex cloud-native applications.

### What is important for AI applications?

Most AI applications are calling APIs from popular AI foundation model services like OpenAI, VertexAI, and Anthropic.
These types of tasks is nothing new for Go, actually Go excels at this type of task.

## Our Plans for Making Go Even Better

We are working on a highly-ergonomic AI interface that will make it easier to use Go for AI applications.
